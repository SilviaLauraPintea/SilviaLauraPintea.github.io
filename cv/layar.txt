To whom it may concern,

I have heard only positive things regarding the work environment in your company as well as how much the research and self-development is encouraged.
I have recently learned of this job opportunity, and applying for this job gives me the chance to find out more about Layar's working environment.
 
I am currently ending my last year as a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam in Computer Vision under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Ir. Arnold Smeulders. 
I have a great passion for Computer Vision and Machine Learning and I do not see myself working in any other field in the future. Next to these two topics, C++ programming is another great interest of mine.
  
I am very much preoccupied by state-of-the-art research in Computer Vision and Machine Learning and I would love to have the opportunity to keep developing myself as a scientist. 
I, additionally, hope to be given the chance of improving my programming skills and software management knowledge.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Silvia-Laura Pintea
